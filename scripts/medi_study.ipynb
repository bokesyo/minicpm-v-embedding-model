Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M).

That is absolutely not the case. These are large programs with many children enrolled. And so if in fact funding does not continue  then  we  have to shut down  our  programs. It is going to take time and many resources to accomplish that. So  we  need Congress to act and extend funding. And  we  really need to get that down this month.\n",

      "Given By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News The six men, sealed since June inside steel containers representing a spacecraft, have \"gone into orbit\" at their destination. Three of the group will now \"descend\" to the planet, don real spacesuits and walk on the \"surface\" of Mars. In reality, this surface will just be the sandy floor of another module at the Moscow-based experiment. The Mars500 project is run by Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems with the participation of the European Space Agency (Esa). It aims to investigate some of the psychological and physiological effects that humans might encounter on a long-duration spaceflight. \"So far, I must say we've had no major problems,\" said Martin Zell, who heads up the Esa scientific programme on the International Space Station (ISS). \"There is permanent monitoring, so we understand their health very well. We have a lot of data now on their mental state and on how their bodies are reacting. That's important because there is a link between the two,\" he told BBC News. The crew comprise three Russians, two EU citizens and a Chinese national. Alexander Smoleevskiy, Sukhrob Kamolov, Alexey Sitev, Diego Urbina, Romain Charles and Wang Yue all had to pass through a rigorous selection procedure to get on the programme, and their \"departure\" on the grounded spaceship last year drew wide international attention and curiosity. For eight months, the group has worked together inside the closed facility which has no windows and a total interior volume of about 550 cubic metres (19,423 cubic feet). The coming days will see Smoleevskiy, Urbina, and Wang enter a \"descent module\", from where they will have access to a further container that has been set up to look like the dusty terrain of Mars. The trio will put on the type of spacesuit worn by real cosmonauts and simulate the sort of geological investigations future astronauts might pursue on the Red Planet one day. Three sorties are planned, with the first outing due to take place on 14 February. A robot rover will assist the Mars walkers, and their activity will be overseen by Mission Control Moscow which normally deals with events on the ISS. \"They will go on to the surface two at a time, with one man staying behind in the landing module,\" explained Dr Zell. \"Working in their suits, they will have a drill to get below the surface; and they will do a virtual analysis of the samples the drill delivers to them. They will also take samples back to the module for further analysis.\" Although the Mars500 experiment has not been able to simulate the constant weightlessness of a genuine eight-month journey through space, it has been able to introduce one important realism - that of a time delay in the communications between the crew and their ground controllers outside the modules. Messages take 20 minutes to pass between the two ends of the link, similar to the lag radio messages travelling the great distance between Mars and Earth would come up against. This proved particularly testing last month when controllers deliberately - and without warning to the crew - cut the power to the modules. They even blew a small amount of smoke into the containers to give the men inside the sensation that they were dealing with a serious electrical failure. \"They spent almost a day without energy,\" Dr Zell said. \"They had to work through their emergency procedures and analyse the situation. They didn't panic and they remembered their training.\" Mars500 is so called because it simulates the duration of a possible human Mars mission in the future using conventional propulsion: 250 days for the trip to the Red Planet, 30 days on the Martian surface and 240 days for the return journey, totalling 520 days. (In reality, it would probably take a lot longer than this.) The six men are due \"back on Earth\" in November.

Walsh played for several clubs, but most notably with Manchester City, for whom he made more than 100 appearances. As an international, Walsh represented four national teams: after playing for the England Schoolboys XI, he then became a dual Irish international, playing for both Ireland teams – the FAI XI and the IFA XI. In 1949, he was a member of the FAI XI that defeated England 2–0 at Goodison Park, becoming the first non-United Kingdom team to beat England at home. He then emigrated to New Zealand and also played in an unofficial game for their national team. Walsh eventually moved to Australia and settled in Noosa, Queensland. In 2003, he and several other former Manchester City players returned for the last game at Maine Road. He died on 28 July 2006 at the age of 85 and his ashes were interred at the Garden of Remembrance at the City of Manchester Stadium.\n",

The 'Lightning Tree' is in the section of the Arena which endures a lightning storm within its hour. The lightning tree introduces (naturally, without raising the suspicions of anyone else) the element of controlled, predictable burst of electricity in a pre-designated location, which obviously is of benefit to Beetee. Furthermore, it is a clear and concise way for the tributes to keep track of what time it is, even if they aren't anywhere near the section that is enduring it's 'hour'. It's the equivalent of Big Ben striking 12. It's never pro-filmically shown that Beetee had discussed a plan with Heavensbee beforehand, but it's interesting that Beetee is insistent on carrying around that spool of electrical wire throughout most of the film. It's quite an encumbrance to keep hold of, 'just in-case', so it could be inferred that Beetee had the plan all along.  <sep>  Q: Was there a purpose for the lightning tree in Catching Fire?\" == \"Yes\" != \"No\"\n",

      "you are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. you need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. the generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. if your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. note that \"flipping\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. often, \"flipping\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \"increase\" to \"decrease.\"\n",

      "\"Which friend does not take a drug that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver?\" == \"Background Paragraph: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. \n",

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n",

You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n",

The work is noted for its vigor of description. With a background of ocean waves, it is a story of married life. Salve Kristiansen loves a beautiful woman named Elisabeth and is evidently loved in return. But for a time Elisabeth is attracted to a young officer who wishes to marry her. The old love for Salve prevails, however, and Elisabeth spurns the officer, but Salve has already left his native land in desperation and is sailing toward foreign shores. When he finally, after some years, returns to his old home, he finds that Elisabeth, after all, has been true to him. He marries her. It would seem that all is well, but such is not the case. The thought of Elisabeth's momentary hesitation does not leave Salve, and this unfortunate circumstance makes life miserable for both. Ten years elapse before the husband and wife finally come to a clear understanding and a genuine appreciation of one another, and now at last are enabled to lay the foundation for a happy life together. The novel emphasizes the need of implicit confidence and trust, if two persons united in wedlock are to live happily together. \n",

First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.\n",

She can be slightly aggressive and I'm starting to get worried and a bit annoyed. How do I stop her? ----Susan, London. Answer: You need to get this problem under control before it could escalate  . I always advise owners not to talk on the mobile phone when they go for a walk with their dogs, because they should be focusing on this time with their pets, but I know people have busy lives and need to make phone calls. The behavior she is showing is either controlling or playfulness, but they both result from the same issue ---- you are not paying attention to her. If you must make phone calls while on a walk, try to still engage with your dog by speaking towards her, playing some sorts of game and so on. If that doesn't work, you'll have to try more of a training approach. You will need a training line and some treats. Start your walk in the usual way, make a phone call, and when your dog starts displaying the undesired behavior, simply stop walking --- otherwise she will see it as a game. When she is calm and looking at you, or if she sits, give her a treat; then continue walking. If she starts up again, pick up the lead, gently pull it, and tell her \"no\".  Then ask her to sit and give her a treat if she does. The aim of this is to try to get her to forget how much fun it is biting your shoes. Do little sessions every day --- and try not to answer the phone if you know it's going to be a long conversation. Be patient and good luck! Remember that if an animal shows signs of distress or discomfort, an early visit to the vet is always recommended. \n",

      "The task is: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. \n",

One of their considerations was to ban performance of \"Ishe Komborera Africa\" in African schools and public performance of it often made people liable for arrest by the British South African Police. The District Commissioner for Gutu abolished the Gutu African Council after its leader opened a meeting by singing \"Ishe Komborera Africa\" in the District Commissioner's presence. The Commissioner also had the leader arrested but he was released without charge. Following the Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980, after Zimbabwe Rhodesia returned to British control as Southern Rhodesia, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union party won to become the first government of an independent Zimbabwe. After this, \"Ishe Komborera Africa\" was selected to replace the official \"God Save the Queen\" of Southern Rhodesia and the unofficial \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" of Rhodesia as the national anthem of an independent Zimbabwe as it was a symbol of black African struggles and solidarity against apartheid systems in South Africa and Namibia. At the Zimbabwean independence ceremony, the Union Jack was lowered to \"God Save the Queen\" and the new flag of Zimbabwe was raised to \"Ishe Komborera Africa\" in Salisbury.\n",

      "\"The Department of Homeland Security announced a new rule in the Federal Register that will allow it to collect immigrants' social media information and search results, BuzzFeed reports. And the rule doesn't just apply to new or soon-to-be immigrants. The social media accounts of green card holders, permanent residents, and naturalized citizens can be surveilled by the federal government. According to Engadget, \"social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\" will be added to what DHS considers \"official records\" for immigrants. If DHS means things like Google search histories when it says \"search results,\" it's unclear how it plans to obtain those, Gizmodo notes. The rule—which goes into effect Oct. 18—has privacy and immigrant groups concerned. \"This collect-it-all approach is ineffective for national security and one more example of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,\" the ACLU states. Others point out the new rules don't just put immigrants under additional surveillance but anyone who communicates with immigrants on social media. Experts say there's little to no evidence social media can be used to determine if someone presents an actual threat. It is, however, good at showing people's political and religious beliefs. \"Folks might share a post on social media that seems ripe for government officials to use as the hook for a conversation that starts to resemble an ideological purity test,\" one professor tells BuzzFeed. (In other social media news, Obama reportedly had a warning for Mark Zuckerberg.)\" == \"This move is certainly not out of the blue -- incorporating social media information into immigrant records in one way or another has been a topic of conversation for a while. In 2015, the DHS began working on a plan to add social media searches into visa application protocol and in 2016 it proposed and implemented a new section in the travel form for foreign visitors coming to the US under the visa waiver program that asks for social media handles. In February, the DHS announced that it was planning to start asking visitors from Trump's travel ban list of countries for not only their social account names, but their passwords as well. And in March reports came out that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ordered social media checks on all visa applicants who had visited ISIS-controlled regions. Additionally, after proposing the plan in May, the Trump administration introduced an expanded visa applicant questionnaire in June that asks for all social media handles used in the last five years. \n",

      " WASHINGTON — Federal officials are planning to collect social media information on all immigrants, including permanent residents and naturalized citizens, a move that has alarmed lawyers and privacy groups worried about how the information will be used. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published the new rule in the Federal Register last week, saying it wants to include \"social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\" as part of people's immigration file. The new requirement takes effect Oct. 18. Adam Schwartz, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for privacy and free expression, said the plan was disturbing. \"We see this as part of a larger process of high-tech surveillance of immigrants and more and more people being subjected to social media screening,\" Schwartz told BuzzFeed News. \"There's a growing trend at the Department of Homeland Security to be snooping on the social media of immigrants and foreigners and we think it's an invasion of privacy and deters freedom of speech.\" This would also affect all US citizens who communicate with immigrants, Schwartz said, who could self-censor out of fear that information they exchange with someone overseas could be misconstrued and used against them. DHS said the amendment posted last week is not a new policy. It was added in an effort to be transparent, to comply with existing regulations, and due to updates in the electronic immigration system the agency said. \"DHS published this notice in the Federal Register on Sept. 18 to comply with the administrative requirements of the Privacy Act to help address these requirements, not launch a new policy initiative,\" the agency said. \"DHS, in its law-enforcement and immigration-process capacity, has and continues to monitor publicly-available social media to protect the homeland.\" \n",
      "  \n",
      " Faiza Patel, codirector of the Brennan Center’s liberty and national security program, said this is yet another fad, started by the Obama administration, fueled by the belief that social media is going to help the US stop an attack in the country. \"It's very difficult to successfully use social media to determine what people are going or not going to do,\" Patel told BuzzFeed News. \"When you look at all the different ways in which we use communication tools, and social media is pretty different, very truncated. People use emojis, they use short form, sometimes it’s difficult to know what something means.\" In February the Office of Inspector General published a report that found DHS pilot programs for using social media to screen applicants for immigration benefits lacked criteria to determine if it’s effective. Another concern, Patel said, is that the information would be used for ideological vetting by the US government who will be looking at people's political and personal views of people abroad and in the US. \"The question is do we really want the government monitoring political views?\" Patel said. \"Social media may not be able to predict violence but it can certainly tell you a lot about a person's political and religious views.\" \n",
      "  \n",
      " Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, said the expansion seems to originate from concerns about Tashfeen Malik, one of the San Bernardino shooters in late 2015. “This is another example of the government changing security protocols based on a previous incident that will impose an enormous cost and that is of dubious value for the future,” Nowrasteh said. “Social media has been used in immigration courts for years but there’s little evidence that it’s helped with visa vetting.” The Trump administration has had an interest in how immigration authorities use social media despite there being no evidence to show it was reliable, according to USCIS presidential transition records. “Yesterday at our briefing with the President-Elect’s Landing Team, one of the things they mentioned they’d be interested in seeing was guidance that we use regarding social media use and when/how we can use social media,” wrote a senior adviser in December. In documents provided to the transition team, the agency said no immigration benefits had been denied solely or primarily because of information uncovered through social media vetting. “In cases of benefit denial, the denial was based on information found outside of social media,” the document said. Three refugee pilot programs to screen social media found that although they were able to find refugees accounts the information did not produce clear links to national security concerns even for applicants who were found to pose a national security threat. \n",
      "  \n",
      " César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, assistant professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, said DHS has a lot of discretion in how it treats information when making a decision on immigration benefits, even if its reliability is questionable. \"The fact that information gleaned from Facebook or Instagram or other social media networks might not be reliable doesn't mean that it will preclude DHS from using it as a basis for excluding people from the United States,\" García Hernández said. Still, García Hernández said, it's important to remember that it's unusual for DHS to decide whether to allow someone into the US based on a single piece of information. \"Folks might share a post on social media that seems ripe for government officials to use as the hook for a conversation that starts to resemble an ideological purity test,\" García Hernández said. There is also the possibility that someone may be hacked and will be held to task for a post or comment, García Hernández said. \"Having government oversight with the potential for life-changing adverse consequences when it comes to social media use by prospective immigrants is a pretty direct affront to the longstanding promotion of free speech that's at the core of the US constitution,\" García Hernández said. \n",

(May 2015)Sam Gillen (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a QuÃ©bÃ©cois convict in the United States who escapes from Federal custody with the aid of his bank-robbing partner. In their last heist, Sam's partner killed a bank guard, a crime for which Sam was ultimately convicted. Sam's partner is killed in the break, forcing Sam to continue on alone. He sets up camp on a piece of farmland owned by Clydie Anderson (Rosanna Arquette), the widowed mother of two kids, Mike (nicknamed \"Mookie\") (Kieran Culkin) and Bree (Tiffany Taubman).While sneaking into Clydie's house to \"borrow\" some salt, Sam catches sight of Clydie taking a shower. The next morning, Sam is spotted bathing outdoors by Mookie. After saving Clydie, Mookie, and Bree from a trio of intruding thugs, Sam learns that Clydie is holding out from selling her land to property developer Franklin Hale (Joss Ackland), who will be put out of business if he does not get Clydie's land so that he can put a tract house development on it.Sam stays in Clydie's barn while repairing her late husband's Triumph motorcycle. Meanwhile Hale has one of his men, Mr. Dunston (Ted Levine), try to force Clydie into selling her land. Secretly on Hale's payroll is the corrupt Sheriff Lonnie Poole (Edward Blatchford), who harbors feelings for Clydie.A jealous Lonnie discovers Sam's true identity and strongly urges him to leave. Sam complies, only to find the state police chasing him. Sam returns to save Clydie from Dunston and Hale, who have forced her to sign a sale agreement in his absence and are about to burn down her house.Sam decides to turn himself in to the authorities after he realizes that running away was never the right thing to do. He promises Clydie that he will come back someday.' == 'Where does Sam stay?' != 'Who does Ray try to reach unsuccessfully when he gets cold feet?'\n",

      "\"1897 England: The schooner Demeter is nearing England. The crew is dead,and the captain is lashed to the wheel. Dracula has arrived.2000 London: Matthew Van Helsing [Christopher Plummer], an aging collector of antiques, and hisprotegee Simon Sheppard [Jonny Lee Miller] are discussing the purchase of a medieval crossbowthat Matthew means to add to his personal collection in the Carfax Museum.Among the artifacts on public display, Carfax Museum also houses aheavily-protected vault, and no one knows what it contains. It must bepretty valuable, though, so another employee, Solina [Jennifer Esposito], has arranged tobreak into the vault and steal whatever is in there.While Matthew sits in his office at the end of the day, Solina andher companions (Marcus, Trick, Nightshade, Dax, Charlie, and J.T) breakthe computer codes and make their way to the main vault, passing numerousvampire skulls and crosses along the way, only to find...a coffin. No onewould think to look for treasure in a coffin, they reason, so this must beit. In searching for a way to open it,Eddie and Dax are impaled by spikes causing an alarm to go off in in Matthew's office. \"It's not possible!\" Matthew whispers to himself, arms himself with a gun thatshoots silver bullets, and goes down to the vault to find that the coffinis gone, the thieves having removed it through a hole they've blasted inthe vault's wall. \"God help us all!\" Matthew exclaims.When Simon comes into work the next day, he finds Matthew preparingto travel. But Matthew won't reveal where he is going, so Simon followshim...all the way to New Orleans.New Orleans: Mary Heller [Justine Waddell] is awakened by a dream in which a vampire isattacking her. Mary has been having this dream for all her life and findsthem troubling enough that she is receiving counseling from her familyfriend, Father David [Nathan Fillion]. She thinks the dreams have to do with something thathappened to her mother before she died, and she thinks Fr David might knowwhat it is. But Fr David isn't talking. On the other hand, Mary'sroommate, Lucy Westerman [Colleen Fitzpatrick] thinks that all Mary needs is a real man in herbed. But it's Mardi Gras, and Mary vows not to let it bother her.Meanwhile, the thieves are transporting the coffin on a cargo plane.Still trying to open it, Nightshade cuts himself. His blood is sucked intothe coffin and the lid opens to reveal a body, a bunch of leeches, and acrucifix set with a ruby. As Nightshade searches the coffin for more treasure,Dracula [Gerard Butler] awakens. One by one, the thieves are drained of their blood, andthe plane ultimately crashes in a swamp near New Orleans, the pilot lashedto his seat. While newscaster Valerie Sharpe [Jeri Ryan] is covering the crash,Dracula emerges from the swamp and makes her his second vampiress (Solinabeing first).Matthew and Simon go to the townhall where the bodies from the planecrash have been taken. By now, they're all vampires. Matthew and Simonmanage to destroy some of them, but Solina and Marcus escape. As Matthewand Simon drive away, Matthew finally fills Simon in on what's happening.Stoker's Dracula is real, he says, and Matthew Van Helsing is reallyAbraham Van Helsing, kept alive by injections of Dracula's blood, which hehas been filtering through leeches. Van Helsing has been keeping Dracula'sbody ever since he bested him in 1897. Unlike other vampires, who can bedestroyed by piercing their hearts or cutting off their heads, Draculacannot die, and Van Helsing intends to remain alive until such time as hecan learn the secret to Dracula's origin and find the way to end him. Sofar, all he has managed to learn is that Dracula hates God and is repulsedby all things Christian. He also reveals that he (Van Helsing) hasfathered a daughter, Mary Heller, and that Dracula has come to New Orleansto find her. The two decide to go looking for Mary, Van Helsing to herhouse and Simon to the Virgin Megastore where she and Lucy both work.Dracula is apparently following the same plan. He comes to Virginlooking for Mary, but Lucy tells him that she isn't there. Lucy takesDracula home to wait for Mary. Dracula seduces Lucy and turns her intovampiress #3. When Simon arrives at Virgin, Mary has returned. Simon triesto tell her about her father. As they leave the shop, Simon is attacked byMarcus. \"Never ever fuck with an antiques dealer,\" Simon warns Marcus justbefore beheading him. Meanwhile, Van Helsing arrives at Mary's house, onlyto find Dracula waiting for him. \"You can't have her!\" Van Helsingexclaims, but Dracula refuses to listen. \"You stole life from my blood andpassed it to another,\" he hisses. \"She's MY Mary now.\" With that, Draculakills Van Helsing by tossing him into a mirror.Mary goes home to find her father dead and the three vampiresses andDracula awaiting her. She escapes into Simon's arms. Looking for a sacredplace to spend the night, they go to a church. While in the parishlibrary, they research Dracula's background, learning only what theyalready know about his despise of all things Christian--holy water, thecross, the Bible. Only his dislike of silver remains unexplained.Suddenly, Dracula appears. Mary flees into the church cemetery while Simonattempts to divert Dracula with an open Bible. Dracula *is*diverted...right into the cemetery where he explains to Mary, \"I havewalked the earth for centuries in search of a soul not bitten but born.Everything I am is yours, and all that you are is mine.\"Dracula takes Mary to the church roof where he reveals to her thesecret of his long existence. He is Judas Iscariot, the disciple who soldout Christ to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver (hence, Dracula's dislikeof silver). In atonement, Judas hung himself, but the rope broke and Godscourged him with eternal life as a vampire. In a soliloquy in front of alighted crucifix, Dracula cries out to God, \"Now I drink the blood of*your* children. You made the world in your image. Now I make it in mine.\"Meanwhile, Simon sees the three vampiresses feasting on Mardi Grasrevelers. He stakes Valerie, but the remaining two capture him. Draculatakes Mary to Simon and tells her to feed from him. \"I'd like his head,\"Mary says while unsheathing a sword. Just as she prepares to swing thesword, Lucy cries out, \"She's faking!\" In the melee that follows, Marybeheads Lucy instead of Simon, Simon beheads Solina, and Dracula winds uphanging by his neck from the lighted crucifix...just as the sun comes up.Dracula bursts into flames. Mary vows to take over her father's job of keeping Dracula's ashes, lest Dracula find a way to return to life.[Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]\" == \"Question: Who plays Matthew Van Helsing?, Answer: christopher plummer\" != \"Question: Why do Dennis's parents choose George and Martha instead of some other babysitter for Dennis?, Answer: Martha loves Dennis as if he were her own grandson\"\n",

Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences e.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In each sentence, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY.:\n",

Do not use the names of real people or generic names (e.g., Donald Trump, John Doe, etc.) in your question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. Make sure that PersonX and PersonY have the same gender. In your question, PersonX and PersonY should be used only ONCE and PersonX should appear earlier than PersonY. Although there are many correct answers, you only need to write one of them.:\n",

      "Represent the example for the following task: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \"small\" and \"big\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.:\n",

Walsh played for several clubs, but most notably with Manchester City, for whom he made more than 100 appearances. As an international, Walsh represented four national teams: after playing for the England Schoolboys XI, he then became a dual Irish international, playing for both Ireland teams – the FAI XI and the IFA XI. In 1949, he was a member of the FAI XI that defeated England 2–0 at Goodison Park, becoming the first non-United Kingdom team to beat England at home. He then emigrated to New Zealand and also played in an unofficial game for their national team. Walsh eventually moved to Australia and settled in Noosa, Queensland. In 2003, he and several other former Manchester City players returned for the last game at Maine Road. He died on 28 July 2006 at the age of 85 and his ashes were interred at the Garden of Remembrance at the City of Manchester Stadium.\n",

It doesn't explicitly state 'Plutarch did this because of this and this...' because that would be terrible clunky writing, and Collins is a much better writer than most people will give her credit for... it just takes a little logic and deduction. The 'Lightning Tree' is in the section of the Arena which endures a lightning storm within its hour. The lightning tree introduces (naturally, without raising the suspicions of anyone else) the element of controlled, predictable burst of electricity in a pre-designated location, which obviously is of benefit to Beetee. Furthermore, it is a clear and concise way for the tributes to keep track of what time it is, even if they aren't anywhere near the section that is enduring it's 'hour'. It's the equivalent of Big Ben striking 12. It's never pro-filmically shown that Beetee had discussed a plan with Heavensbee beforehand, but it's interesting that Beetee is insistent on carrying around that spool of electrical wire throughout most of the film. It's quite an encumbrance to keep hold of, 'just in-case', so it could be inferred that Beetee had the plan all along.  <sep>  Q: Was there a purpose for the lightning tree in Catching Fire?\" == \"Yes\" != \"No\"\n",

      "Given By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News The six men, sealed since June inside steel containers representing a spacecraft, have \"gone into orbit\" at their destination. Three of the group will now \"descend\" to the planet, don real spacesuits and walk on the \"surface\" of Mars. In reality, this surface will just be the sandy floor of another module at the Moscow-based experiment. The Mars500 project is run by Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems with the participation of the European Space Agency (Esa). It aims to investigate some of the psychological and physiological effects that humans might encounter on a long-duration spaceflight. \"So far, I must say we've had no major problems,\" said Martin Zell, who heads up the Esa scientific programme on the International Space Station (ISS). \"There is permanent monitoring, so we understand their health very well. We have a lot of data now on their mental state and on how their bodies are reacting. That's important because there is a link between the two,\" he told BBC News. The crew comprise three Russians, two EU citizens and a Chinese national. Alexander Smoleevskiy, Sukhrob Kamolov, Alexey Sitev, Diego Urbina, Romain Charles and Wang Yue all had to pass through a rigorous selection procedure to get on the programme, and their \"departure\" on the grounded spaceship last year drew wide international attention and curiosity. For eight months, the group has worked together inside the closed facility which has no windows and a total interior volume of about 550 cubic metres (19,423 cubic feet). The coming days will see Smoleevskiy, Urbina, and Wang enter a \"descent module\", from where they will have access to a further container that has been set up to look like the dusty terrain of Mars. The trio will put on the type of spacesuit worn by real cosmonauts and simulate the sort of geological investigations future astronauts might pursue on the Red Planet one day. Three sorties are planned, with the first outing due to take place on 14 February. A robot rover will assist the Mars walkers, and their activity will be overseen by Mission Control Moscow which normally deals with events on the ISS. \"They will go on to the surface two at a time, with one man staying behind in the landing module,\" explained Dr Zell. \"Working in their suits, they will have a drill to get below the surface; and they will do a virtual analysis of the samples the drill delivers to them. They will also take samples back to the module for further analysis.\" Although the Mars500 experiment has not been able to simulate the constant weightlessness of a genuine eight-month journey through space, it has been able to introduce one important realism - that of a time delay in the communications between the crew and their ground controllers outside the modules. Messages take 20 minutes to pass between the two ends of the link, similar to the lag radio messages travelling the great distance between Mars and Earth would come up against. This proved particularly testing last month when controllers deliberately - and without warning to the crew - cut the power to the modules. They even blew a small amount of smoke into the containers to give the men inside the sensation that they were dealing with a serious electrical failure. \"They spent almost a day without energy,\" Dr Zell said. \"They had to work through their emergency procedures and analyse the situation. They didn't panic and they remembered their training.\" Mars500 is so called because it simulates the duration of a possible human Mars mission in the future using conventional propulsion: 250 days for the trip to the Red Planet, 30 days on the Martian surface and 240 days for the return journey, totalling 520 days. (In reality, it would probably take a lot longer than this.) The six men are due \"back on Earth\" in November.

      "The task is: In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n",

      "\"1897 England: The schooner Demeter is nearing England. The crew is dead,and the captain is lashed to the wheel. Dracula has arrived.2000 London: Matthew Van Helsing [Christopher Plummer], an aging collector of antiques, and hisprotegee Simon Sheppard [Jonny Lee Miller] are discussing the purchase of a medieval crossbowthat Matthew means to add to his personal collection in the Carfax Museum.Among the artifacts on public display, Carfax Museum also houses aheavily-protected vault, and no one knows what it contains. It must bepretty valuable, though, so another employee, Solina [Jennifer Esposito], has arranged tobreak into the vault and steal whatever is in there.While Matthew sits in his office at the end of the day, Solina andher companions (Marcus, Trick, Nightshade, Dax, Charlie, and J.T) breakthe computer codes and make their way to the main vault, passing numerousvampire skulls and crosses along the way, only to find...a coffin. No onewould think to look for treasure in a coffin, they reason, so this must beit. In searching for a way to open it,Eddie and Dax are impaled by spikes causing an alarm to go off in in Matthew's office. \"It's not possible!\" Matthew whispers to himself, arms himself with a gun thatshoots silver bullets, and goes down to the vault to find that the coffinis gone, the thieves having removed it through a hole they've blasted inthe vault's wall. \"God help us all!\" Matthew exclaims.When Simon comes into work the next day, he finds Matthew preparingto travel. But Matthew won't reveal where he is going, so Simon followshim...all the way to New Orleans.New Orleans: Mary Heller [Justine Waddell] is awakened by a dream in which a vampire isattacking her. Mary has been having this dream for all her life and findsthem troubling enough that she is receiving counseling from her familyfriend, Father David [Nathan Fillion]. She thinks the dreams have to do with something thathappened to her mother before she died, and she thinks Fr David might knowwhat it is. But Fr David isn't talking. On the other hand, Mary'sroommate, Lucy Westerman [Colleen Fitzpatrick] thinks that all Mary needs is a real man in herbed. But it's Mardi Gras, and Mary vows not to let it bother her.Meanwhile, the thieves are transporting the coffin on a cargo plane.Still trying to open it, Nightshade cuts himself. His blood is sucked intothe coffin and the lid opens to reveal a body, a bunch of leeches, and acrucifix set with a ruby. As Nightshade searches the coffin for more treasure,Dracula [Gerard Butler] awakens. One by one, the thieves are drained of their blood, andthe plane ultimately crashes in a swamp near New Orleans, the pilot lashedto his seat. While newscaster Valerie Sharpe [Jeri Ryan] is covering the crash,Dracula emerges from the swamp and makes her his second vampiress (Solinabeing first).Matthew and Simon go to the townhall where the bodies from the planecrash have been taken. By now, they're all vampires. Matthew and Simonmanage to destroy some of them, but Solina and Marcus escape. As Matthewand Simon drive away, Matthew finally fills Simon in on what's happening.Stoker's Dracula is real, he says, and Matthew Van Helsing is reallyAbraham Van Helsing, kept alive by injections of Dracula's blood, which hehas been filtering through leeches. Van Helsing has been keeping Dracula'sbody ever since he bested him in 1897. Unlike other vampires, who can bedestroyed by piercing their hearts or cutting off their heads, Draculacannot die, and Van Helsing intends to remain alive until such time as hecan learn the secret to Dracula's origin and find the way to end him. Sofar, all he has managed to learn is that Dracula hates God and is repulsedby all things Christian. He also reveals that he (Van Helsing) hasfathered a daughter, Mary Heller, and that Dracula has come to New Orleansto find her. The two decide to go looking for Mary, Van Helsing to herhouse and Simon to the Virgin Megastore where she and Lucy both work.Dracula is apparently following the same plan. He comes to Virginlooking for Mary, but Lucy tells him that she isn't there. Lucy takesDracula home to wait for Mary. Dracula seduces Lucy and turns her intovampiress #3. When Simon arrives at Virgin, Mary has returned. Simon triesto tell her about her father. As they leave the shop, Simon is attacked byMarcus. \"Never ever fuck with an antiques dealer,\" Simon warns Marcus justbefore beheading him. Meanwhile, Van Helsing arrives at Mary's house, onlyto find Dracula waiting for him. \"You can't have her!\" Van Helsingexclaims, but Dracula refuses to listen. \"You stole life from my blood andpassed it to another,\" he hisses. \"She's MY Mary now.\" With that, Draculakills Van Helsing by tossing him into a mirror.Mary goes home to find her father dead and the three vampiresses andDracula awaiting her. She escapes into Simon's arms. Looking for a sacredplace to spend the night, they go to a church. While in the parishlibrary, they research Dracula's background, learning only what theyalready know about his despise of all things Christian--holy water, thecross, the Bible. Only his dislike of silver remains unexplained.Suddenly, Dracula appears. Mary flees into the church cemetery while Simonattempts to divert Dracula with an open Bible. Dracula *is*diverted...right into the cemetery where he explains to Mary, \"I havewalked the earth for centuries in search of a soul not bitten but born.Everything I am is yours, and all that you are is mine.\"Dracula takes Mary to the church roof where he reveals to her thesecret of his long existence. He is Judas Iscariot, the disciple who soldout Christ to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver (hence, Dracula's dislikeof silver). In atonement, Judas hung himself, but the rope broke and Godscourged him with eternal life as a vampire. In a soliloquy in front of alighted crucifix, Dracula cries out to God, \"Now I drink the blood of*your* children. You made the world in your image. Now I make it in mine.\"Meanwhile, Simon sees the three vampiresses feasting on Mardi Grasrevelers. He stakes Valerie, but the remaining two capture him. Draculatakes Mary to Simon and tells her to feed from him. \"I'd like his head,\"Mary says while unsheathing a sword. Just as she prepares to swing thesword, Lucy cries out, \"She's faking!\" In the melee that follows, Marybeheads Lucy instead of Simon, Simon beheads Solina, and Dracula winds uphanging by his neck from the lighted crucifix...just as the sun comes up.Dracula bursts into flames. Mary vows to take over her father's job of keeping Dracula's ashes, lest Dracula find a way to return to life.[Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]\" == \"Question: Who plays Matthew Van Helsing?, Answer: christopher plummer\" != \"Question: Why do Dennis's parents choose George and Martha instead of some other babysitter for Dennis?, Answer: Martha loves Dennis as if he were her own grandson\"\n",

Salve Kristiansen loves a beautiful woman named Elisabeth and is evidently loved in return. But for a time Elisabeth is attracted to a young officer who wishes to marry her. The old love for Salve prevails, however, and Elisabeth spurns the officer, but Salve has already left his native land in desperation and is sailing toward foreign shores. When he finally, after some years, returns to his old home, he finds that Elisabeth, after all, has been true to him. He marries her. It would seem that all is well, but such is not the case. The thought of Elisabeth's momentary hesitation does not leave Salve, and this unfortunate circumstance makes life miserable for both. Ten years elapse before the husband and wife finally come to a clear understanding and a genuine appreciation of one another, and now at last are enabled to lay the foundation for a happy life together. The novel emphasizes the need of implicit confidence and trust, if two persons united in wedlock are to live happily together. \n",

Questions that involve temporal reasoning/understanding contain one of the following five temporal phenomena: First: \"event duration\", is defined as the understanding of how long events last (e.g.,\"brushing teeth\" usually takes a few minutes). Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \"being born in the U.S.\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \"being hungry\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \"event ordering\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\"). Fourth: \"absolute timepoint\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \"going to school\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" of events, which refers to how often events are repeated (e.g., \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.).

A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept.

      "Article: Question: I have a one-year-old female bulldog, who has recently taken to biting my shoes when we are in the park and I'm on the mobile. She can be slightly aggressive and I'm starting to get worried and a bit annoyed. How do I stop her? ----Susan, London. Answer: You need to get this problem under control before it could escalate  . I always advise owners not to talk on the mobile phone when they go for a walk with their dogs, because they should be focusing on this time with their pets, but I know people have busy lives and need to make phone calls. The behavior she is showing is either controlling or playfulness, but they both result from the same issue ---- you are not paying attention to her. If you must make phone calls while on a walk, try to still engage with your dog by speaking towards her, playing some sorts of game and so on. If that doesn't work, you'll have to try more of a training approach. You will need a training line and some treats. Start your walk in the usual way, make a phone call, and when your dog starts displaying the undesired behavior, simply stop walking --- otherwise she will see it as a game. When she is calm and looking at you, or if she sits, give her a treat; then continue walking. If she starts up again, pick up the lead, gently pull it, and tell her \"no\".  Then ask her to sit and give her a treat if she does. The aim of this is to try to get her to forget how much fun it is biting your shoes. Do little sessions every day --- and try not to answer the phone if you know it's going to be a long conversation. Be patient and good luck! Remember that if an animal shows signs of distress or discomfort, an early visit to the vet is always recommended. \n",

The next morning, Sam is spotted bathing outdoors by Mookie. After saving Clydie, Mookie, and Bree from a trio of intruding thugs, Sam learns that Clydie is holding out from selling her land to property developer Franklin Hale (Joss Ackland), who will be put out of business if he does not get Clydie's land so that he can put a tract house development on it.Sam stays in Clydie's barn while repairing her late husband's Triumph motorcycle. Meanwhile Hale has one of his men, Mr. Dunston (Ted Levine), try to force Clydie into selling her land. Secretly on Hale's payroll is the corrupt Sheriff Lonnie Poole (Edward Blatchford), who harbors feelings for Clydie.A jealous Lonnie discovers Sam's true identity and strongly urges him to leave. Sam complies, only to find the state police chasing him. Sam returns to save Clydie from Dunston and Hale, who have forced her to sign a sale agreement in his absence and are about to burn down her house.Sam decides to turn himself in to the authorities after he realizes that running away was never the right thing to do.

      "The task is: In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. \n",

First: \"event duration\" which is defined as the understanding of how long events last. For example, \"brushing teeth\", usually takes few minutes. Second: \"transient v. stationary\" events. This category is based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not. For example, the sentence \"he was born in the U.S.\" contains a stationary event since it will last forever; however, \"he is hungry\" contains a transient event since it will remain true for a short period of time. Third: \"event ordering\" which is the understanding of how events are usually ordered in nature. For example, \"earning money\" usually comes before \"spending money\". The fourth one is \"absolute timepoint\". This category deals with the understanding of when events usually happen. For example, \"going to school\" usually happens during the day (not at 2 A.M). The last category is \"frequency\" which refers to how often an event is likely to be repeated. For example, \"taking showers\" typically occurs ~5 times a week, \"going to Saturday market\" usually happens every few weeks/months, etc.\n",
