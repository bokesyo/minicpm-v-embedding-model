  "query": "Why do we hear static from radios and TV's when there's nothing being broadcast? Shouldn't we just hear silence?",
  "doc": "Because there isn't nothing there. Every spectrum is full of random noise from stars, radioactive decay, all sorts of things like that. It's just terrestrial broadcasts are so much stronger that it overwhelms the random noise. This is why when you start reaching the edge of the coverage area for the station you're listening to, it starts getting more and more static-ey and doesn't just go from \"fine\" to \"nothing.\""
