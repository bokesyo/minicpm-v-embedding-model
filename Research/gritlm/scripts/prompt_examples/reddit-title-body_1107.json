  "query": "Boiling on electric burners (sloooow)",
  "doc": "I re-started homebrewing in December (after a 2-year hiatus).  My apartment has an electric stove, and the burners are fairly small.  The biggest problem I'm having is that I can barely bring the liquid to a boil, even when I cover the pot.  Once I get it to a rolling boil it's okay, but getting the wort up to temperature takes 2-3 hours.\n\nAny ideas for dealing with this?  Should I just use less liquid? (currently boiling 3 gallons, then adding water up to 5 gallons)  Or is there another trick that might save me some time?"
