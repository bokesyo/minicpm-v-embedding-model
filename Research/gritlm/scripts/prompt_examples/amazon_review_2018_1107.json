  "query": "Actually makes me want to pick up poop...",
  "doc": "so nice to not have to get close to the poop. All i do is spray it off for the next use before i put it away and never have to touch the bad stuff.  You can pick up A LOT of poop before you have to empty the scoop. Helps if the poop is hard, gets messy if not, but like i said you can just spray it off if it does"
