  "query": "On May 3, 2010, a prisoner with mental illness incarcerated at a \u201csupermax\u201d facility in the Colorado State Penitentiary in Canon City filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiff sued the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC), the warden of the Colorado State Penitentiary, and the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Corrections. The plaintiff alleged violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.  The plaintiff, represented by the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center and the University of Denver Civil Rights Clinic, alleged that by placing him in segregation for over a decade and not allowing him to experience daylight, fresh air, or outdoor exercise, the defendants had denied him numerous privileges afforded to other prisoners because of his mental illness. Further, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants denied him appropriate treatment for serious mental health issues. In the alternative, the plaintiff pleaded that the defendants punished him for his actual or perceived disability-related behavior without reasonable accommodations. He alleged that the prison made him ineligible for early release credits due to an arbitrary demerit system that punished his improperly treated mental illness without notice of what behaviors he was charged with and without sufficient procedures for review. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages under the Rehabilitation Act, and attorneys' fees and costs. This case was assigned to Judge R. Brooke Jackson and referred to Magistrate Judge Kathleen M. Tafoya. \n\nOn May 25, 2010, the defendants moved to dismiss the case and the district court denied the motion. On March 26, 2012, both the plaintiff and the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment were denied on the merits. 848 F.Supp.2d 1291. The case proceeded to a bench trial which occurred between April 30 and May 8, 2012. On August 28, 2012, the court released a final order and judgment. 887 F. Supp. 2d 1133. The court stated: \"denial of any opportunity to be outdoors and to engage in some form of outdoor exercise for a period of 12 years is a serious deprivation of a human need\" and is \"a paradigm of inhumane treatment.\" The court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff since it found a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The court ordered the CDOC to develop and present a plan that ensured the plaintiff had access to outdoor exercise for at least one hour three times a week. The court also ordered that the defendants assign a CDOC psychiatrist to evaluate the plaintiff's mental health treatment needs. The court noted that the formulary list of pre-approved medication could not be a bar to the plaintiff receiving whatever medication the psychiatrist deemed appropriate. Because the CDOC\u2019s system for disciplinary proceedings had changed during the course of litigation, the court ruled in favor of the defendants to give their new policy a chance. However, the judge wrote in his opinion that if the new system proved to be \"form over substance, [the plaintiff] knows where to find me.\" The court found that the plaintiff largely prevailed, and therefore awarded him costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nThe plaintiff made subsequent motions: to alter or amend the judgment (September 21, 2012), for post-judgment discovery (November 16, 2012), and to enforce the settlement agreement regarding attorneys\u2019 fees (July 15, 2013). The court granted the motion for discovery on January 2, 2013 and denied the other motions without prejudice on September 4, 2013. That same day, the court found that the exercise cells being used at CDOC\u2019s Sterling facility did not amount to an acceptable permanent solution for providing an opportunity to exercise. It also found that there was uncertainty about how the mental health treatment issue was being resolved, as it was unclear whether there was inadequate treatment available or whether the plaintiff was refusing to accept available treatment.\n\nPer the parties\u2019 request, the court permitted them to engage in settlement discussions. The parties received several time extensions until the court made clear that it would not continue to grant extensions indefinitely. \n\nOn September 12, 2014, the plaintiff moved to enforce the August 28, 2012 judgment and further relief or, in the alternative, for a hearing on the order to show cause by the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff had been given a more substantial opportunity to exercise and access to mental health treatment, he was concerned that he would not be provided these services in the future.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, the court issued an order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion. 2015 WL 1593884. The court noted that the plaintiff had been permitted to exercise outside since July 2014 and had been placed on a treatment plan by a psychologist in the facility the month before. The court expressed its confidence in the CDOC\u2019s leaders\u2019 commitment to following through on the policy changes made in the prison.\n\nThere have been no further developments since the April 2015 order.

This is a maximum security facility where each inmate is placed in administrative segregation, sometimes called \u201cAd Seg.\u201d Mr. Anderson is confined alone in a small cell at all times except for approximately five visits each week of about one to one and one quarter hours each when he is taken to a similarly small cell with a pull-up bar for exercise followed by a shower. He has essentially no direct human contact except with CDOC staff.\nAlthough his lengthy Complaint described a long list of issues, the gist of this case can fairly be divided into three separate but related complaints. First, he alleges that he has been denied appropriate diagnosis and treatment for serious mental health issues. Second, because the Colorado State Penitentiary provides no facility for outside exercise, he has not seen the sun or the outside world for more than eleven years, resulting in physical and mental harm. Third, although inmates theoretically can earn their way out of the Colorado State Penitentiary by successfully completing a five-level Quality of Life Level Program (\u201cQLLP\u201d), he has been unable to do so because of an arbitrary demerit system that in turn punishes his improperly treated mental illness.\nMr. Anderson asserts six claims: (1) that he has been deprived of a liberty interest without the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment by the manner in which defendants have administered demerits, called \u201cnegative chrons,\u201d that has prevented him from progressing to higher levels and ultimately out of Ad Seg; (2) that he has been deprived of a liberty interest without due process by reason of defendants\u2019 failure to provide an appropriate medication request and review procedure and, therefore, necessary medications; (3) that defendants\u2019 failure to provide appropriate mental health treatment has also violated his Eighth (and Fourteenth) Amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment; (4) that\n2\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 14\ndefendant\u2019s denial of outdoor exercise over the period of time Mr. Anderson has been in Ad Seg violates his Eighth (and Fourteenth) Amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment due to defendants\u2019 denial of outdoor exercise; (5) that discrimination on the basis of his mental impairment violates the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.; and (6) such discrimination also violates the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978 (\u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 et seq.\nCONCLUSIONS. A. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [#47]. Plaintiff seeks a summary judgment that denial of outdoor exercise for more than 11 years violates his right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. The Eighth Amendment applies to state action through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. To establish that a condition of confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, an inmate must show both an objective component, i.e., that a prison deprivation was sufficiently serious (such as by denying the minimal civilized measure of life necessities) and a subjective component, i.e., that prison officials acted with a culpable state of mind (some form of wanton conduct at least amounting to deliberate indifference as compared to inadvertence or good faith error). Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298-304(1991). To obtain summary judgment, plaintiff must show that it is beyond any genuine dispute of fact that he has been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Tenth Circuit has on occasion addressed prisoner demands for outdoor exercise. In one case it noted that \u201c[t]here is substantial agreement among the cases in this area that some form of outdoor exercise is extremely important to the psychological and physical well being of\n3\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 14\ninmates, and some courts have held a denial of fresh air and exercise to be cruel and unusual punishment under certain circumstances.\u201d Bailey v. Shillinger, 828 F.2d 651, 653 (10th Cir. 1987). To my knowledge, however, no court has held that denial of fresh air and exercise is a per se Eighth Amendment violation. It depends on the facts of the particular case.\nIn Ajaj v. U.S., 293 F. App\u2019x 575 (10th Cir. 2008)(unpublished) the court considered allegations that the inmate had been prevented from exercising outside during his first year at the Administrate Maximum United States Penitentiary in Florence, Colorado and intermittently thereafter. Those allegations did not rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. Id. at 584. However, \u201ca factfinder might conclude that the risk of harm from three years of deprivation of any form of outdoor exercise was obvious and that DOC officials disregarded that risk by keeping [the inmate] in administrative segregation.\u201d Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1260 (10th Cir. 2006).\nPlaintiff contends that virtually all other federal and state prisons in the country, including the most secure institutions, provide an outdoor exercise facility; that prison experts agree that this is appropriate and important; that the Colorado State Penitentiary has an outdoor courtyard that was designed for outdoor recreation but is used for storage; that the Penitentiary also has substantial open space where an outdoor recreation area could be located; that, particularly due to the length of his deprivation of such exercise, Mr. Anderson has sustained both physical and mental harm; and that CDOC\u2019s continued failure and refusal to make outdoor exercise available to him constitutes deliberate indifference.\nDefendants respond that Mr. Anderson is able to exercise indoors, and that he has not shown that the inability to exercise outdoors causes physical or mental harm. Defendants argue that providing daily outdoor exercise to approximately 750 offenders (a request that Mr.\n4\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 14\nAnderson does not appear to be making) is not feasible; that giving Mr. Anderson but not others the opportunity for outdoor exercise (another request that plaintiff does not appear to be making) would create management and security problems; that the QLLP program is designed to motivate inmates to cooperate and behave so as to progress to a higher level; and that the Court should defer to the broad discretion of prison administrators to manage prisons safely and effectively.\nThe Court finds that these issues are replete with factual disputes. Indeed, it is all but inconceivable to this Court that a matter of such potentially great significance both to the CDOC and to inmates at the Colorado State Penitentiary would be decided on summary judgment without a full evidentiary record. Plaintiff\u2019s motion is denied.\nB. [Defendants\u2019] Motion for Summary Judgment [#48]. Defendants advance seven arguments, collectively amounting to the allegation that none of plaintiff\u2019s claims turn on genuine disputes of material fact, and that all of the claims should be dismissed as a matter of law. 1. Statute of limitations. Defendants argue that any claim accruing before May 3, 2008 (two years before this case was filed) is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Defendants made the same argument in their motion to dismiss filed and briefed earlier in this case. The Court, by Chief Judge Daniel, denied the motion. The Court concluded that the period of limitations applicable to the claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (One through Four) is two years from the date that Mr. Anderson knew or should have known of the injury that was the basis for the claim. [#37] at 4-5. Similarly, the period of limitation applicable to the two statutory claims (Five and Six) is two years from the date when he knew of should have known of the cause of his injuries. Id. at\n5\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 14\n5-6. The Court held that, although claims accruing prior to May 3, 2008 might be barred, it could not determine from the face of the Complaint that any of the claims are barred. Id. at 6-8.\nIn the pending motion for summary judgment, defendants focus only on plaintiff\u2019s Second Claim, and specifically on the allegation that Mr. Anderson was improperly denied two medications, Strattera and Wellbutrin, that had been prescribed for him. Defendants note, as they did in their motion to dismiss, that Mr. Anderson alleged that he was denied Strattera by the formulary board at the Colorado State Penitentiary on July 15, 2004, and the board denied Wellbutrin in April 2007. The Court found it to be unclear from the face of the Complaint when the internal appeal process was complete or whether Mr. Anderson continues to appeal the denials of those medications. [#37] at 7. Defendants now present the affidavit of Darren Lish, M.D., a staff psychiatrist at the CDOC, who states that no appeal was taken from the denial of Wellbutrin. Id. \u00b620. Defendants also point to plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he did not have a right to appeal and did not appeal.\nPlaintiff responds that he grieved the denial of Wellbutrin, the only avenue available to him, and that the grievance was finally denied on August 7, 2008. Ex. 19 to Robertson aff. [#503] at 12. Defendants respond that Mr. Anderson knew or should have known of his injury when Wellbutrin was denied, not when his grievance process concluded.\nIt does not appear that plaintiff now disputes that his claim arising from the 2004 denial of Strattera is time barred. I agree with the plaintiff, however, that because there was a form of \u201cappeal\u201d by way of the grievance procedure, his filing of a Complaint based on the denial of Wellbutrin was timely. Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment based upon the statute of limitations is granted as to the Strattera denial but is otherwise denied.\n6\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 14\n2. Change in Prison Policy. Defendants next argue that plaintiff was prescribed Wellbutrin and provided it in December and, therefore that his claim based on the denial of Wellbutrin is moot. A case becomes moot and must be dismissed where the underlying controversy is resolved, and the court \u201ccannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\u201d Church of Scientology of California v. U.S., 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992). However, \u201c[t]he heavy burden of persuading the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.\u201d Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000). The prescription of Wellbutrin in December 2010 does not moot a claim that its previous denial was improper. Moreover, the previous denial was apparently based on the drug\u2019s not being on the \u201cformulary.\u201d A doctor\u2019s non-formulary prescription of Wellbutrin was denied. The drug apparently is now on the formulary. However, whether that was simply a temporary change, and whether Mr. Anderson will continue to be given the drug if prescribed by a physician, are issues of fact that cannot be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. 3. Prison Litigation Reform Act. Defendant points out that, under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e), \u201c[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\u201d Defendants argue that this bars plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensatory damages under the Rehabilitation Act, because plaintiff has not alleged that he sustained physical injuries. Plaintiff does not dispute that the Prison Litigation Reform Act applies to his claims under the Rehabilitation Act (and the ADA). However, he submits an affidavit in which he\n7\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 14\nstates that the lack of outdoor exercise has caused his muscles to grow weaker. [#47-2] \u00b673. That is sufficient to create a fact dispute that prevents summary disposition.\n4. Plaintiff\u2019s Due Process Claims (Claims One and Two). Defendants argue that plaintiff has not shown that the periodic reviews regarding his classification status in the QLLP or the process for obtaining non-formulary medications involve a liberty interest that could support a due process claim. To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must establish: (1) that he has a liberty or property interest protected by the due process clause, and (2) that the procedures utilized were inadequate under the circumstances. See Veile v. Martinson, 258 F.3d 1180, 1184-85 (10th Cir. 2001). Plaintiff must demonstrate a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to the right asserted in the Complaint. Kentucky Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989). The issue with respect to the periodic reviews was addressed in Toevs v. Reid, 646 F.3d 752 (10th Cir. 2011). The court concluded on the record before it that an inmate\u2019s indefinite placement in the QLLP at the Colorado State Penitentiary that actually lasted for years, in the type of conditions described by Mr. Toevs (similar to those described by Mr. Anderson), established a protected liberty interest; and that because Mr. Toevs did not receive periodic reviews that provided meaningful guidance as to how he was progressing or when he might be returned to the general population, his constitutional rights were violated. Id. at 753, 756-60. Whether the facts of the present case are sufficiently different to warrant a different conclusion is an issue that is inappropriate for summary judgment. With regard to his claim based on the review process for non-formulary medications, plaintiff argues that no reasons were given for the original denial, and that he was not permitted directly to appeal the denial. He alleges that there are not meaningful or sufficient procedural\n8\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 14\nprotections, and that they leave open the possibility of decisions that are arbitrary or based on bias, discrimination or prejudice. He further argues that CDOC\u2019s denial of his non-formulary medications without adequate process \u201cimposes an atypical and significant hardship on [him] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84.\nThe Court finds that CDOC\u2019s denial of his non-formulary medication could impose the type of hardship warned of in Sandin if Mr. Anderson can show that a primary reason he has not progressed out of Ad Seg is because his mental illness has been improperly and inadequately treated due to the non-formulary request and appeal procedures. The Court finds there is a genuine fact dispute about whether that occurred here.\n5. Plaintiff\u2019s Eighth Amendment Claim Relating to the Adequacy of his Mental Health Treatment.\nDefendants argue that plaintiff cannot establish an Eighth Amendment violation on the basis of inadequate mental health treatment. As defendants acknowledge, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment is violated if a defendant\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d Self v. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1230 (10th Cir. 2006)(internal citations omitted). Plaintiff must establish two elements: objectively that his medical need is sufficiently serious, and subjectively that the defendant \u201cknew of and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health and safety.\u201d Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994)(internal citations omitted). Because defendants concede, at least for purposes of the present order, that Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental health condition is sufficiently serious to satisfy the first element, the Court will focus on whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the second element.\n9\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 14\nA defendant is deliberately indifferent where he was both \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he [drew] the inference.\u201d Ibid. Delaying medical treatment can violate the Eighth Amendment if the delay itself \u201creflect[s] deliberate indifference which results in substantial harm.\u201d Olson v. Stotts, 9 F.3d 1475, 1477 (10th Cir. 1993). The Tenth Circuit has defined substantial harm to mean a \u201clifelong handicap, permanent loss, or considerable pain.\u201d Garrett v. Stratman, 254 F.3d 946, 949-50 (10th Cir. 2001).\nIt is not disputed that plaintiff has not received certain medications prescribed by physicians for the treatment of his mental illness. The significance of his not receiving those medications is a matter of medical judgment and testimony. The Court agrees with defendants that a difference in medical judgment is not sufficient to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. Coppinger v. Townsend, 398 F.2d 392, 394 (10th Cir. 1968)(stating \u201c[t]he prisoner\u2019s right is to medical care- not to the type or scope of medical care which he personally desires.\u201d). However, that does not foreclose the possibility that medical or mental health treatment will be so inadequate that it will rise to the level of an Eighth Amendment violation. The Court concludes that plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants were deliberately indifferent to his mental health issues.\n6. Plaintiff\u2019s Eighth Amendment Claim for the Denial of Outdoor Exercise. For the reasons stated above in regard to plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment,\ndefendants\u2019 motion is denied. Genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the deprivation was sufficiently serious and whether the defendants acted intentionally or with deliberate indifference. Wilson, 501 U.S. at 298-99.\n10\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 11 of 14\n7. Plaintiff\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act Claims.2 The ADA prohibits discrimination by public entities on the basis of disability. The\nRehabilitation Act prohibits such discrimination by recipients of federal funding. To state a claim under the ADA (and the Rehabilitation Act) a \u201cplaintiff must allege that: (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability, (2) who was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity\u2019s services, programs, or activities, and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or discrimination was by reason of a disability.\u201d Robertson v. Las Animas County Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, 500 F.3d 1185, 1193 (10th Cir. 2007).\nPlaintiff alleges, and it is not disputed for present purposes, that he suffers from a mental impairment that rises to the level of a disability. He has not received the benefit of completion of the QLLP. He contends that this is because of CDOC\u2019s refusal to provide reasonable accommodation in the form of necessary medication and treatment. The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not provide a private right of action for substandard medical care. Fitzgerald v. Corrections Corp. of America, 403 F.3d 1134, 1144 (10th Cir. 2005). In other words, these statutes do not create a federal remedy for medical malpractice. However, that is not the gist of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Rather, he argues that he was unable successfully to complete the QLLP because of his mental impairment and that, despite doctors\u2019 prescription of drugs that would have treated the mental impairment and would have enabled him to progress through the program, CDOC prevented him from obtaining the drugs. Defendants argue that he has been fully accommodated, citing Dr. Lish\u2019s affidavit [#48-2] at \u00b650. Dr. Lish states, in conclusory language perhaps drafted by others, that \u201cMr. Anderson has received appropriate, timely treatment by his treating clinicians and treating psychiatrists while he has been incarcerated with\n2 \u201cThe Rehabilitation Act is materially identical to and the model for the ADA,\u201d the elements are the same except that the Rehabilitation Act requires that defendant receive federal funds. Crawford v. Indiana Dep\u2019t of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 483 (7th Cir. 1997).\n11\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 14\nthe CDOC. Ibid. Plaintiff responds by citing, among other things, the affidavit of Raymond Patterson, M.D., who states that Mr. Anderson has not received adequate treatment. This fact dispute is sufficient to deny summary resolution of the issue without the need to look further.\nC. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Reopen Discovery for a Limited Purpose [#65]. Plaintiff wishes to reopen discovery to depose Dr. Erin Lenocker, someone who has had \u201cinteractions\u201d with Mr. Anderson and is listed as a witness by defendants, and Dr. Vicki Tuakoi, Mr. Anderson\u2019s new mental health provider. 1. Deposition of Dr. Lenocker. Dr. Lenocker was not identified in defendants\u2019 initial disclosures as a person with knowledge. However, she was disclosed during the course of discovery when defendants supplemented their initial disclosures with an incident report on which plaintiff relied in taking the deposition of Dr. Lampela. Defendants also relied on the incident report, written by Dr. Lenocker, in their Motion for Summary Judgment. Counsel states that Dr. Lenocker has been listed on defendants\u2019 \u201cmay call\u201d list, and because counsel does not know what she will say, plaintiff is prejudiced to the point that a deposition should be permitted or the witness should be stricken. It is disappointing to the Court that counsel have not been able or willing to resolve this relatively minor dispute by agreement. In any event, I do not agree with the premise that just because a lawyer does not know precisely what a potential witness will say, a deposition is necessarily critical. That kind of thinking is one thing that has contributed to the high if not outrageous cost of civil litigation in the modern era. It does not appear to the Court that Dr. Lenocker is a major player in this drama. It does appear that plaintiff\u2019s counsel already know a fair amount about where she fits into it. Yes, defendants probably should have listed her in its\n12\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 14\ndisclosures. Nevertheless, we are well past the discovery cutoff, trial is approaching, and it is time for the lawyers to devote their attention to finding the forest in the vast expanse of trees that have been developed and written about in the various motions. The request to reopen discovery for a deposition of Dr. Lenocker is denied. The Court orders that if defendants elect to call Dr. Lenocker as a witness, they should make her available to one of the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers for a brief interview \u201cin the hall\u201d before she is called.\n2. Deposition of Dr. Tuakoi. Plaintiff argues and defendant does not dispute that Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental health\ntreatment has changed at least somewhat since the close of discovery. Although Dr. Tuakoi does not appear on either party\u2019s witness list, she apparently is Mr. Anderson\u2019s current mental health provider and might be in the best position to provide an update. This information might be particularly relevant to plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief. Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys state that they only recently learned of Dr. Tuakoi\u2019s involvement through defendants\u2019 supplementation of plaintiff\u2019s mental health records. Defendants respond that the request to depose Dr. Tuakoi was made six months after Mr. Anderson himself was being treated by her. However, I am not sure Mr. Anderson is a reliable source of current treatment information for his attorneys.\nDefendants have not shown that they would be prejudiced beyond the obvious time and expense that one more deposition would require. In the circumstances the Court orders that defendants make Dr. Tuakoi available for a deposition limited to one hour, exclusive of any cross examination by defense counsel. The lawyers should exercise their best efforts to pick a time and place that accommodate Dr. Tuakoi\u2019s schedule. The deposition may be taken by telephone if both parties agree.\n13\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 80 Filed 03/26/12 USDC Colorado Page 14 of 14\nORDER. 1.

DATED this 26th day of March, 2012.\nBY THE COURT:\n___________________________________ R. Brooke Jackson United States District Judge\n14\n\n\f Case 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 1 of 40\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\nCivil Action No. TROY ANDERSON,\nPlaintiff, v. STATE OF COLORADO, DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, SUSAN JONES, in her official capacity as warden of Colorado State Penitentiary, and ARISTEDES W. ZAVARAS, in his official capacity as Executive Director of the Colorado\nDepartment of Corrections, Defendants.\nCOMPLAINT\nPlaintiff Troy Anderson, incarcerated in the Colorado State Penitentiary in Ca\u00f1on City, Colorado, submits this complaint for violations of his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.\nPARTIES 1. Plaintiff TROY ANDERSON is, and was at all times relevant herein, a citizen of the United States. Mr. Anderson has been a prisoner confined in the Colorado Department of Corrections since May 25, 2000. Mr. Anderson suffers from severe mental illness that\n1\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 2 of 40\nsubstantially limits several of his major life activities, including, but not limited to, thinking, learning, concentrating, and interacting with others. Mr. Anderson also has a record of such impairments and is regarded by Defendants as having such impairments. 2. Defendant COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS (\u2015CDOC\u2016) is a department of the State of Colorado. The department is responsible for all inmates in the state\u2019s prison population. 3. Defendant SUSAN JONES is the Warden of Colorado State Penitentiary (\u2015CSP\u2016) and as such, is responsible for the custody and care of Mr. Anderson, and all prisoners in CSP. She oversees all employees at CSP, and has authority for the establishment and implementation of all policies and procedures at the institution. 4. Defendant ARISTEDES W. ZAVARAS is the Executive Director of CDOC and as such, is responsible for the custody and care of Mr. Anderson and all prisoners in CDOC. He oversees all employees in CDOC, and has authority to establish, alter, and implement all policies and procedures within CDOC.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 5. This Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343. 6. Venue of this action is proper in the District of Colorado under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b).\nNATURE OF THE CASE 7. Defendants are excluding Mr. Anderson from programs and activities, denying him privileges afforded nondisabled prisoners, and otherwise discriminating against him based on conduct (more accurately, Defendants\u2019 perception of the possibility of conduct) that is a direct\n2\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 3 of 40\nresult of his disability and/or based on Defendants\u2019 perception of him as disabled and/or his history of disability, while at the same time denying him access to the diagnosis and treatment that would permit him to control that conduct. Among the programs and activities to which he is being denied access are those that would permit him to progress out of administrative segregation and reduce the length of his sentence. Defendants\u2019 discrimination thus has the effect of isolating and segregating him within the prison and prolonging his sentence. In the alternative, to the extent that Defendants are punishing him for behavior \u2013 or their perceived possibility of behavior \u2013 that is the result of his disability, he is entitled to the reasonable accommodation of conditions. 8. Ever since he was a young child, Mr. Anderson has suffered from a severe mental disability \u2013 likely caused by an organic brain syndrome \u2013 preventing him from performing major life activities, such as learning and interacting with others and causing him to have mood swings, severe depression and bouts of impulsive behavior. Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental health history demonstrates that he cannot function properly absent proper treatment and accommodations. Even though Defendants are aware of his long history of mental health concerns, for nearly a decade they have failed to provide him adequate mental health care and have discriminated against Mr. Anderson because of his disability. 9. Even when Defendants\u2019 own doctors have prescribed medications that they believed necessary to treat Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental conditions, Defendants have repeatedly refused to provide such medication. Mr. Anderson was never informed of why he could not receive these ordered medications, and why he is denied access to these and other medications most likely to address his mental health needs.\n3\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 4 of 40\n10. Furthermore, the failure to provide adequate treatment has resulted in further discrimination, as Mr. Anderson has repeatedly been denied the ability to progress out of segregation, based on behavior that is the direct result of his disability. He also was denied access to Offenders with Mental Illness\u2014a program designed for inmates with mental illnesses. This denial was specifically because of the manifestations of his mental disability, behaviors that have not been appropriately addressed. Accordingly, Mr. Anderson seeks to have his mental health needs diagnosed and treated appropriately with the proper medication. 11. Defendants \u2013 who have already held Mr. Anderson in solitary confinement for nearly a decade \u2013 continue to retain him there indefinitely. While Mr. Anderson does not have a life sentence, his retention at CSP essentially ensures that he will die in prison. If he were allowed to earn his way out of CSP administrative segregation he would be eligible for good time credits, which could greatly reduce his sentence. But, as a matter of policy, CSP prisoners are ineligible for these credits, even with good behavior. 12. Instead of providing treatment to address these behaviors and allow Mr. Anderson to progress out of segregation, Defendants continue to subject Mr. Anderson to punitive measures. Defendants assert that their punitive policies, for example limiting prisoners to owning only two books, are an incentive for prisoners to behave. Yet, when the behavior (or perceived possibility of behavior) is a result of a mental health condition, these intentionally restrictive policies fail to provide any meaningful incentive, or further a legitimate penological goal. Rather, they merely punish Mr. Anderson for his mental illness. 13. Among the punitive measures leveled against Mr. Anderson, Defendants have a policy to never allow him \u2013 or any other inmate at Colorado\u2019s \u2015supermax\u2016 \u2013 outside. Accordingly, Mr.\n4\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 40\nAnderson has gone nearly a decade without seeing or feeling the sun. His only recreation takes place in the \u2015day hall,\u2016 an indoor room with a floor, ceiling, and four walls. The \u2015day hall\u2016 is not outside, nor does it allow even a view of the sun. Mr. Anderson has access to this \u2015day hall\u2016 merely five hours a week, during which time he also must shower. Furthermore, time in the \u2015day hall\u2016 is not guaranteed and is frequently cancelled during prison lockdowns. Although Defendants are aware that many CSP prisoners, including Mr. Anderson, do not have access to the outside for years or decades, they have been deliberately indifferent to this substantial mental and physical health risk. Defendants have simply ignored the detrimental health effects a person experiences when he is not allowed time outdoors in the sun and fresh air. Mr. Anderson seeks to have this inhumane form of punishment ended, and to be able to regularly feel the sun and wind on his skin. 14. CDOC continues to hold Mr. Anderson in the solitary conditions at CSP through a monthly review process that is entirely arbitrary and insufficient. Under the current review system, if an inmate receives a \u2015chron\u2016 he cannot leave solitary confinement. A \u2015chron\u2016 is a note of negative or positive behavior entered into the prisoner\u2019s record at the discretion of prison personnel, which is used to determine a prisoner\u2019s security classification. However, the issuance of chrons is arbitrary; a guard can enter one for any behavior, including small, subjective infractions such as \u2015being non-responsive.\u2016 Prisoners have no notice of chrons, cannot dispute their issuance, and there is no meaningful way for inmates to challenge the chrons after their issuance, as there is with formal infractions. Yet, even absent these protections, the chrons have as much impact on a prisoner\u2019s review as formal disciplinary infractions, which are given for more serious prisoner misconduct only after a disciplinary hearing process. Furthermore, the\n5\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 6 of 40\nprison uses these chrons in violation of their own operational memorandum. Mr. Anderson seeks to have this practice abolished and replaced with a system that recognizes a prisoner\u2019s right to due process in determining his or her classification.\nFACTS A. Mr. Anderson has a long history of mental health concerns and treatment. 15. Mr. Anderson was born on November 12, 1969. He was adopted as an infant by Darrell and Carol Anderson. 16. Mr. Anderson has had mental health issues throughout his life. According to his mother and father, Mr. Anderson has struggled with his emotions from the time he was a baby. Numerous reports have been written by mental health professionals to document the existence of Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental illnesses and disabilities. 17. Mr. Anderson began treatment for his mental health issues starting at age five when his parents treated his bedwetting with imipramine, an antidepressant, and noticed positive behavioral side effects. 18. Over the years Mr. Anderson has been diagnosed and assessed with many mental health illnesses, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anti-Social Personality Disorder, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, bipolar disorder, cognitive disorder, a seizure disorder and polysubstance dependence. 19. According to Mr. Anderson and his parents, outside a proper therapeutic setting, he has never been able to control his emotions and anger, which has resulted in family dysfunction and Mr. Anderson being incarcerated for 23 of his 40 years.\n6\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 40\n20. Throughout his childhood Mr. Anderson struggled with mental illness and suicidal ideations. In 1980, at age ten, Mr. Anderson took an automatic pistol from his father\u2019s gun collection intending to commit suicide. 21. Shortly after this incident, Mr. Anderson wrote a note to his teacher indicating that he had bad feelings and sometimes wished he were dead. In response to this note, his parents had him admitted to the Mental Health Center of Boulder County (\u2015MHCBC\u2016) under a \u2015crisis intake.\u2016 22. At the MHCBC, Dr. Schmitt determined that even as a child, Mr. Anderson already had \u2015mood swings and strong guilt feelings around his aggressive and explosive urges.\u2016 23. At MHCBC, Mr. Anderson also was evaluated by Dr. Larson who diagnosed Mr. Anderson with Attention Deficit Disorder (\u2015ADD\u2016). 24. Dr. Larson ordered that Mr. Anderson\u2019s imipramine be discontinued and ordered Mr. Anderson\u2019s ADD be treated with Ritalin. At the time, Mr. Anderson\u2019s parents noted a positive \u2015remarkable change\u2016 to their son\u2019s behavior after his ADD was properly medicated. However, Mr. Anderson\u2019s parents discontinued his medication after only a few months. 25. In 1983, Mr. Anderson ran away from home and threatened to kill himself. Mr. Anderson tried both family and individual therapy, but ultimately his parents sought assistance from mental health professionals at several facilities. During this time, he repeatedly tried to hurt himself, cutting himself on multiple occasions, at times severely enough to require stitches. On more than one occasion he ran away from the facility. 26. In 1984, Mr. Anderson was placed at the Boulder Psychiatric Institute (\u2015BPI\u2016) as part of a plea agreement for several non-violent crimes.\n7\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 8 of 40\n27. At BPI, Mr. Anderson was seen by Dr. Freedman in August of 1984. Dr. Freedman believed Mr. Anderson was probably psychotic and recommended treatment with antipsychotic medication. 28. While at BPI, Mr. Anderson received comprehensive behavior therapy along with recommended medications. During his time at BPI, staff noted that Mr. Anderson\u2019s psychosis, rage, and violent acting out had significantly improved and that he had made \u2015considerable progress.\u2016 29. When Mr. Anderson was released from BPI at the age of sixteen, he had a variety of diagnoses. Despite these conditions, his medications were discontinued upon release. 30. Without proper medication and treatment Mr. Anderson\u2019s behavior deteriorated. In May 1987, a warrant was issued for Mr. Anderson\u2019s arrest for aggravated armed robbery and theft. 31. Mr. Anderson was eventually arrested in California. While in jail in California, Mr. Anderson attempted suicide twice. In November 1987, Mr. Anderson was sent back to Colorado to the custody of CDOC. He was placed by court order at the Fort Logan Mental Health Center (\u2015Fort Logan\u2016) for mental health testing. 32. As part of the court order, the judge required that Mr. Anderson be evaluated by a mental health professional. Dr. Eugene Schwartz evaluated Mr. Anderson. In Dr. Schwartz\u2019s report to the court, he stated that Mr. Anderson was mentally ill and that a prison environment would be very likely to lead to Mr. Anderson becoming psychotic and suicidal. 33. After the court-ordered mental health evaluation, Mr. Anderson was discharged from Fort Logan in March 1988 and committed to the Mount View School (\u2015Mount View\u2016) (now Mount\n8\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 40\nView Youth Services Center) in the Closed Adolescent Treatment Center for a term of five years for aggravated robbery. 34. Within seven days of being transferred to Mount View, Mr. Anderson attempted suicide. 35. Mr. Anderson was later transferred into CDOC custody at Fremont Correctional Facility to serve the remainder of his sentence in an adult facility. In March of 1991, Mr. Anderson was transferred to Centennial Correctional Facility (\u2015CCF\u2016). 36. Frustrated by not being properly diagnosed and treated throughout his life, Mr. Anderson started refusing mental health treatment and started acting out. 37. Following this gap in mental health care, Mr. Anderson\u2019s behavior continued to worsen. He had many confrontations with other inmates and CDOC staff, write-ups from CDOC staff, an additional assault charge, and placement in administrative segregation in October 1993 at CSP for his behavior. 38. Based on his erratic behaviors and mental health concerns while incarcerated at CSP, Mr. Anderson was sent to San Carlos Correctional Facility (\u2015SCCF\u2016), a CDOC facility for mentally ill prisoners, for evaluation in October 1996. However, Mr. Anderson did not receive the appropriate mental health treatment because he was returned shortly to CSP. 39. After being returned to CSP, Mr. Anderson did not participate in mental health services because of his frustration with CDOC and struggles with his mental health. 40. In October 1997, at age twenty-seven, Mr. Anderson was released from CSP. 41. For the next year, Mr. Anderson was incarcerated intermittently. He used illegal drugs to self-medicate his mental health issues, including methamphetamines, to which he became addicted.\n9\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 10 of 40\n42. In December 1998, Mr. Anderson was arrested by Commerce City Police an attempted to escape arrest, but eventually surrendered. 43. In March 1999, Mr. Anderson again attempted to escape police captivity while being transported, but surrendered to police. 44. According to court documents, when asked for Mr. Anderson\u2019s statement at the presentence interview for his convictions in 2000, Mr. Anderson responded, \u2015I wish I would have done more to get on medication so this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u2016 45. On March 20, 2000, Mr. Anderson was convicted of charges related to menacing as well as attempted murder related to his escape attempts. 46. His mother testified at the trial that she wanted him to get the proper help and medications he has always needed throughout his life. 47. Adams County Judge Richter, in his recommendations for Mr. Anderson at his sentencing on March 20, 2000, advised CDOC that Mr. Anderson needed mental health services and recommended he be sent to SCCF to be evaluated and given such services as part of the sentence. B. Mr. Anderson has not received proper treatment, diagnoses and medication while at\nCSP. 48. CDOC has been on notice of Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental health care needs from the beginning of his first incarceration in 1991 through today. 49. Mr. Anderson\u2019s extensive mental health concerns are documented in CDOC\u2019s own records, as well as records provided to them from other mental health institutions, providers and court documents. These records establish his mental health disabilities and his need for on-going mental health diagnosis, treatment, and proper medication. In addition, since his incarceration in\n10\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 11 of 40\n2000, Mr. Anderson has continually asked for help, participated in, and advocated for the mental health services he needs. 50. Following sentencing for his March 2000 convictions, Mr. Anderson was placed directly into administration segregation at Denver Reception and Diagnostic Center (\u2015DRDC\u2016). Shortly thereafter, Mr. Anderson was moved from DRDC to administrative segregation at CSP. 51. After a few months at CSP, Defendants moved Mr. Anderson to SCCF to be treated for his mental health issues in October 2001. 52. While at SCCF, Mr. Anderson worked with mental health staff. Mr. Anderson was noticeably less angry, irritable and combative while at SCCF where he was receiving treatment. 53. While at SCCF Mr. Anderson\u2019s medications were adjusted when medical staff determined that some of his prescriptions had side effects that made him more unstable and combative. Defendants acknowledged that Mr. Anderson\u2019s behavior had been impacted by these prescriptions. 54. After only one month of promising treatment at SCCF, CDOC transferred Mr. Anderson back to CSP. 55. This move occurred against the wishes of his therapists and doctors at SCCF, who believed that SCCF was the best placement to address Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental illnesses. 56. In his brief time at SCCF in 2001, Mr. Anderson was initially assessed as having Intermittent Explosive Disorder (\u2015IED\u2016) and Anti-Social Personality Disorder (\u2015ASPD\u2016). However, because CDOC allowed Mr. Anderson to stay at SCCF for only a short time, additional necessary testing was not completed.\n11\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 40\n57. For the past decade, since his return from SCCF, Mr. Anderson has been housed at CSP and has not been provided proper mental health care. Despite requests and recommendations from his therapists at CSP for neurological testing and other diagnostic tests, CDOC failed to take steps to accurately determine his mental health needs. 58. After his return to CSP in 2001, Mr. Anderson slipped into a depression. For the first few months, he did not actively participate in mental health treatment, including taking medication. However, recognizing he needed help, he soon began seeking treatment. 59. Staff at CSP disregarded the work done by mental health professionals at SCCF and prescribed the same medications that had given him the side effect of being combative, and that had been determined to be a cause of many problems for Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson realized what these medications would do to him from his treatment at SCCF and refused to take them. 60. Mental health staff did not employ the standard mental health practice of trying Mr. Anderson on a variety of mental health medications, taking note of the efficacy of each, specifically to determine what would work for him. 61. Upset with the inadequate treatment he was receiving, Mr. Anderson went on a hunger strike in November of 2000, in an attempt to bring attention to the conditions and unfair policies facing prisoners at CSP. The hunger strike was specifically focused on the lack of treatment for himself and other individuals with mental health disabilities. He remained on his hunger strike for two weeks and lost over ten pounds. 62. During his time at CSP, Defendants have failed to provide Mr. Anderson with adequate mental health treatment. At times, Mr. Anderson did not receive any mental health treatment.\n12\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 13 of 40\nMr. Anderson repeatedly requested additional mental health care, even voicing his concern about the inadequacy of his care to the warden. 63. In April of 2004, Dr. Steele administered to Mr. Anderson an Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\u2015ADHD\u2016) test and evaluated him as having \u2015significant\u2016 symptoms in 17 out of 18 factors. CSP mental health staff has acknowledged that this test indicates Mr. Anderson suffers from severe adult ADHD. 64. Stimulant treatment is common for adult ADHD. The only non-stimulant medication used for adult ADHD that is generally accepted by the medical community for adults is Strattera. 65. According to the Colorado Department of Corrections Formulary regulations no stimulant medications are authorized unless an inmate is granted an exception at the request of his doctor. 66. Defendants\u2019 psychiatrist prescribed Mr. Anderson Wellbutrin, a stimulant, and Strattera, the stimulant alternative, to treat his ADHD. However, Defendants have refused to provide Mr. Anderson either of these medications or any other stimulant equivalent that would work to treat his ADHD. 67. Defendants have recognized Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental disabilities, including ADHD and other diagnoses. 68. Despite recognizing his severe mental illness, Defendants continually fail to treat Mr. Anderson\u2019s mental illnesses with appropriate medication. 69. Mr. Anderson\u2019s psychiatric medications have been mismanaged and, at times, used inappropriately to punish Mr. Anderson by CSP staff. In one instance, CSP assigned a physician\u2019s assistant, Travis Waters, to oversee Mr. Anderson\u2019s psychiatric medications rather\n13\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 14 of 40\nthan a psychiatrist. After a disagreement between Mr. Anderson and the Mr. Waters about what medications were appropriate, Mr. Anderson refused further meetings with him. Mr. Anderson did so because he did not believe Mr. Waters had his best interest in mind. 70. Rather than trying to resolve this issue by further discussion or consideration of Mr. Anderson\u2019s concerns, Mr. Waters retaliated against Mr. Anderson by abruptly discontinuing his prescription of the drug Effexor, which he was receiving for anxiety in February 2007. As a result, Mr. Anderson experienced extreme symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, severe headaches and dizziness. 71. The manufacturer of Effexor informs providers and patients that discontinuation of the drug can cause the appearance of new symptoms, including: agitation, anorexia, anxiety, confusion, impaired coordination and balance, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dysphoric moods, nightmares, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, headaches, hypomania, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, sweating, tremors, vertigo, vomiting and more. The manufacturer recommends not taking anyone off the drug without gradually lowering the dosage. 72. Defendants have continually failed to provide necessary testing and treatment to Mr. Anderson. 73. CDOC psychiatrist Dr. Peggy Steele noted on September 1, 2006 that Mr. Anderson continues to be diagnosed with ADHD and Cognitive Disorder NOS. She said he seems to \u2015display traits\u2016 of Borderline Personality Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder with Narcissistic features. She also mentions IED is congruent with much of Mr. Anderson\u2019s erratic behavior and mania throughout his life.\n14\n\n\fCase 1:10-cv-01005-RBJ-KMT Document 1 Filed 05/03/10 USDC Colorado Page 15 of 40\n74. Defendants have been on notice that Mr. Anderson needs further testing to determine his mental health care diagnoses and needs. "
