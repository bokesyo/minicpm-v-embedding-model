        "Got these for my chocolate lab and it gave her diarrhea.  I also have a black lab mix and she can chew on them just fine.  To be fair though, this chocolate lab has a very sensitive stomach.  I have to take her own food when I board her at the kennel and I don't have to do that for my other dogs so if your dog doesn't have that sensitive a system, I think these will work just fine.  My black lab loves them.  (I just have to keep them away from my chocolate lab.)"
