The above image is a page from a book. Your task is to come up with multiple natural, precise, and ingenious question that can "GUIDE" someone to RECALL this page when she/he sees your question (we call this a RECALL question). Do you understand what I mean? The page of book I provide above will answer the question you have come up with.

Please output your thinking process in JSON format:

```json
{{
"discussion": "[Discuss the content in this page, think of its meaning, main idea, and thoughts to convey etc. of this page to ensure that you truly understand it. Restrict the length to <5 sentences.]",
"easy_query": "[Come up with a 'RECALL question' for this page, please make sure it is specific and straight-forward.]",
"hard_query": "[Come up with another 'RECALL question' for this page, but this time, make sure it is intuitive, it should include higher level of reasoning/intuition/imagination. ]",
}}
```

Tips:
The question you come up with should be presented with `non-ambiguity`: This description method avoids pronouns, opting instead for repeated use of specific nouns or clear descriptions for clarity. The advantage is the elimination of ambiguity, allowing information recipients to understand references `without needing to backtrack through the text`.
